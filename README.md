# Download
Downloads are available [here](https://github.com/ElPumpo/BlockWin10Update/releases).

You can of course clone this project and build it yourself really easily as it requires no dependencies, built on VS2015. Keep in mind of the restrictions you have due to the license.

# Methods
Creates a DWORD in your registry named `DisableGWX` in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\GWX` with the value `1`. That's why the application require a privileged account.

# Command line arguments
`-log` logs to `BlockWin10Update YYYY-MM-DD.log`. If a log file with the same date already exists the logger will instead be logging to `BlockWin10Update YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.log`.

`-block` blocks the update.

`-unblock` unblocks the update.

Blocking and unblocking via the command line is not recommended. Note that unblocking when no key exists, the application will throw a exception.

# Requirements
+ .NET Framework 4.5.2

# Example scripting
The application outputs errorlevels if command line arguments are used. Here's a example if you're planning to for whatever reason.
run.bat:
```
title BlockWin10Update Example Script
:main
cls
echo 1. Block
echo 2. Unblock
echo.
set choice=
set /p choice=Choice: 
if "%choice%"=="1" (
start /wait BlockWin10Update.exe -block
goto status_%errorlevel%
)
if "%choice%"=="2" (
start /wait BlockWin10Update.exe -unblock
goto status_%errorlevel%
)
goto main

:status_0 ::successful
echo Done!
exit /b 0

:status_1 ::error adding to registry
echo An error occurred whilst trying to modify the registry.
exit /b 1

:status_2 ::other or unknown error
echo An unknown error occurred, please rerun the applcation without any command line arguments.

pause
```
